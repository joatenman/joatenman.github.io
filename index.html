        <p>Hello! First off, apologies on the absolute trainwreck that this website is, but don't worry, the perfectionist in me is FUMING more than you'll ever know. Anyhow, there may be a few oddities that already stand out about me, but I'm sure we'll get along just fine... as opposites come together, right?</p>
        <p>First thing that probably stands out is my age. Prior to enrolling at UNSW, I've already done an undergraduate degree in business in my home city and worked in a corporate environment. Long story short, my decision to go back to school largely stems from wanting to elevate my set of technical skills and improve my professional opportunities.</p>
        <p>Second thing that may stand out is my home city. For those like me who would've failed geography class, Montreal is part of the only francophone province (Quebec) in Canada. So alongside English and Mandarin, I can fluently speak French as well!</p>
        <p>I grew up watching a lot of anime like One Piece, FMAB, and HxH, and playing YuGiOh, although recently I'm more into basketball, board games, and *trying* to engage in healthy lifestyles. Looking very forward to being part of the devsoc community at UNSW :)</p>
